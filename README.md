# BBC News Clone
BBC News Website Clone with Tailwind CSS (https://alfathmuqoddas.github.io/bbc-clone/)

## About This Project
I'm making this apps as a practice to sharpen my skills in replicating the design wireframe. I also really like the UI/UX of the BBC Website which has this kind of tiles style UI. This kind of UI involving lots of grid css and flexbox css.

## Technology Used
For building this project I'am using HTML5, vanilla css for some specific styling, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for majority styling, and [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) for generating the photos in the website.

## Challenge
The UI/UX of this BBC clone website involving massive use of grid css and making grid with just plain css is quite tidious jobs, not to mention this website is also fully responsive, so instead of using vanilla css I'm using css framework Tailwind CSS for the majority of styling. Tailwind CSS is low level css framework so it's very flexible to style the page with the style we want and making the website page responsive so easily.
